UKSEDS Olympus Rover Trials 

 Overview

Welcome to the repository for the MANN-E Rover system, a custom-built planetary rover developed for the UKSEDS Olympus Rover Trials.

This project represents the complete software stack for an autonomous and remotely operated rover prototype. The system integrates advanced hardware control, sensor fusion (IMU + Encoders), a Flask-based web control interface, and a robust computer vision pipeline for environmental interaction.

 Key Features & Technical Stack

The rover's architecture relies on Python 3 for high-level control and Arduino C++ for low-level motor/sensor management, communicating via serial.
Feature Area	Key Functionality	Core Files & Technology
Control Dashboard (GUI)	Live video feed, real-time sensor telemetry, and arranged buttons for manual and automated missions.	app.py (Flask), index.html, style.css
Kinematics & Autonomy	Logic for precise odometry (using fused IMU/Encoder data) and executing turn-then-drive autonomous sequences.	kinematics.py, automation_controller.py
Sensor Fusion	Processing data from the IMU and wheel encoders to calculate the rover's 2D pose (X, Y, θ) and monitor Roll/Pitch.	imu.py, encoders.py, hardware.py
Computer Vision	System for real-time video streaming, camera servo control, and OpenCV detection of mission-critical QR codes.	qr.py, camera_scan_controller.py, servo_cam.py
System Interface	Handles the essential communication (Serial/I2C) and system health checks.	serial_comm.py, heartbeat.py

 Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

To run the rover code, you will need the following dependencies and hardware setup:

    Raspberry Pi (preferably Pi 4/5) with SSH enabled.

    Python 3 environment.

    Required physical hardware (motors, IMU, encoders, camera, servo).

Getting Started

    Clone the Repository:
    Bash

git clone https://github.com/gokulsp1995/rover-code.git
cd rover-code

Install Python Dependencies:
Bash

# Run this command on your Raspberry Pi
pip3 install flask opencv-python-headless RPi.GPIO smbus


Run the Flask Server:
Bash

    # This launches the web control dashboard
    python3 app.py

    Access the control interface from your laptop's browser: http://<your_pi_ip_address>:5000
